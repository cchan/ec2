A few things that I use on my EC2 server.

router
------
Migrated to [cchan/ec2-router](https://github.com/cchan/ec2-router)

mailerr
-------
Migrated to [cchan/ec2-mailerr](https://github.com/cchan/ec2-mailerr)

aws-setup.sh
------------
Poorly updated. A copy of the commands that I used to bootstrap the Amazon Linux EC2 server from scratch.

node
----
Just a test server, nothing fancy.

py
--
A rather complex arrangement in which you can register domains *.ec2.clive.io and upload stuff to them via FTP.
